// Determine whether typeinfo names for the same type are merged (in which
// case comparison can just compare pointers) or not (in which case strings
// must be compared), and whether comparison is to be implemented inline or
// not.  We used to do inline pointer comparison by default if weak symbols
// are available, but even with weak symbols sometimes names are not merged
// when objects are loaded with RTLD_LOCAL, so now we always use strcmp by
// default.  For ABI compatibility, we do the strcmp inline if weak symbols
// are available, and out-of-line if not.  Out-of-line pointer comparison
// is used where the object files are to be portable to multiple systems,
// some of which may not be able to use pointer comparison, but the
// particular system for which libstdc++ is being built can use pointer
// comparison; in particular for most ARM EABI systems, where the ABI
// specifies out-of-line comparison.  The compiler's target configuration
// can override the defaults by defining __GXX_TYPEINFO_EQUALITY_INLINE to
// 1 or 0 to indicate whether or not comparison is inline, and
// __GXX_MERGED_TYPEINFO_NAMES to 1 or 0 to indicate whether or not pointer
// comparison can be used.

// LIBSUPCXX:
// The libsupcxx code is meant for static, single binary programs. We can
// always merge typeinfo names in that case. Therefore, the
// __GXX_MERGED_TYPEINFO_NAMES and the corresponding code have been deleted.
// Futhrermore, __GXX_TYPEINFO_EQUALITY_INLINE seems to be only required
// by ARM <= v7. We're only interested in v8+.
